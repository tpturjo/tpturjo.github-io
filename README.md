# Overview
I created this "Personal Portfolio Website" because I felt a resume wasn't enough to fully express my experiences, passions, and the projects I've worked on. I wanted a simple platform where I could share more about myself, my skills, and the work I've done. I built this basic version of the website in just one day, so it's straightforward, but it serves its purpose for now.

# Features
- Simple Navigation: Easy to browse through different sections of my professional life.
- About Me: A brief introduction to who I am and what drives my career in technology.
- Skills and Experience: A summary of my technical abilities and past experiences.
- Project Details: A quick look at the projects I have completed and my hands-on coding experience.
- Contact Info: Direct access to reach me for connections or opportunities.

# Conclusion
While it is a basic website for now, it reflects my desire to go beyond a traditional resume and showcase my work in a more dynamic way. As I grow and learn, I will try to evolve this website along with my skills.
