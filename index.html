      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello there! I'm Tridib Paul Turjo, currently a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Smart Systems at Memorial University of Newfoundland. My passion for technology ignited during my teenage years, and I've been on an exciting journey of exploration ever since. I'm particularly drawn to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics for their incredible capabilities.
        <br><br>
        I approach life with a logical and adaptable mindset, which helps me tackle problems creatively. I thrive in collaborative settings, always eager to contribute my best to a team. Beyond my tech interests, I have a range of hobbies that I enjoy. I may not be a professional musician, but playing the guitar brings me joy. In my free time, I indulge in street photography, capturing candid moments. Engaging in meaningful conversations about politics, diverse cultures, and religions is another interest of mine. These discussions broaden my horizons and allow me to see the world from various perspectives.
        <br><br>
        To me, life is an adventure filled with ups and downs. I cherish every moment and make the most of each experience. Let's embark on this journey together and discover the incredible facets that life has to offer.

        <h2>Project Name:Simple ATM Application</h2>
        <p>The ""Simple ATM Application" is a Java project that replicates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). Users can interact with their bank accounts, make deposits and 
          withdrawals, and view account information. The application provides a user-friendly graphical interface for easy access to basic banking operations. This project demonstrates my 
          Java programming skills, object-oriented design, and graphical user interface development expertise, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio as a practical financial software example.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h2>Project Name: Personal Portfolio Website</h2>
        <p>Personal Portfolio Website" is a beginner-level project created using HTML and CSS. This website serves as a platform to showcase my skills, experiences, and projects. The site 
          features a user-friendly navigation menu, an "About Me" section introducing myself, a section displaying my technical skills and experience, and a list of projects I've worked on. Additionally, there's 
          a "Contact Me" section with links to my email and social media profiles. While I'm still learning, this project is a stepping stone in my journey to create functional and aesthetically pleasing web pages, 
          and I plan to continue improving it as I enhance my web development skills.</p>

        <h2>Project Name: Performance Review Web Application</h2>
        <p> Our four-member team, consisting of myself, Daniel, Caleb, and Tanjeet, is currently working on a project called the "Performance Review Web Application" as part of our COMP2005 course in Fall 2023. This web-based 
          application is being developed using a stack of technologies including Python, HTML, CSS, Bottle (a Python web framework), and SQL for database management.<br><br>

          The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly tool that supports the process of conducting performance reviews within a team and maintains the data and information related to these reviews. As we are in the 
          development phase, our vision includes setting up review schedules, checking the completion status of scheduled reviews, and conducting reviews on individual and team performance. Registered users will have access to 
          their own reviews and the ability to enter new ones. Reviews may be structured with headings and checklists, and users can start draft reviews and return to them later before submitting a final version. Additionally, 
          reviews could be published to other registered users, either with the author's identity or anonymously.<br><br>
          
          This project is a collaborative effort, and our four-member team is dedicated to delivering a practical and efficient tool for performance reviews. We are on track to complete it by the end of this semester and are 
          excited to see it evolve with more features and enhancements as the project progresses.</p>
