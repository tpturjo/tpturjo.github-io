      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello there! I'm Tridib Paul Turjo, currently a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Smart Systems at Memorial University of Newfoundland. My passion for technology ignited during my teenage years,
         and I've been on an exciting journey of exploration ever since. I'm particularly drawn to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics for their incredible capabilities.
        <br><br>
        Outside of academics, I love playing the guitar and capturing moments through street photography. I enjoy engaging in conversations on various topics to broaden my perspective.
        <br><br>
        To me, life is an adventure filled with ups and downs. I try to cherish every moment and make the most of each experience.

        <div class="project-details" id="project1Details" style="display: none;">
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>The "Simple ATM Application" is a comprehensive Java-based simulation that emulates the core functionalities of a typical Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This project is not just a demonstration of my ability to replicate an ATM's functionality, but 
            it also 
            showcases my skills in Java programming, particularly in object-oriented programming and creating graphical user interfaces.</p>
          <h3>Functionality</h3>
          <p>The application allows users to interact with virtual bank accounts in various ways. It supports basic banking operations such as depositing and withdrawing funds, alongside displaying detailed account information. The system incorporates several 
            classes
             representing different aspects of banking, like individual bank accounts, savings and cheque accounts with their unique features, and a central bank class managing these accounts.</p>
          <h3>User Interface</h3>
          <p>What sets this application apart is its user-friendly graphical interface, designed for ease of use. It closely mimics the real-world ATM experience, ensuring that users can intuitively navigate through different banking options. This aspect of the 
            project
             highlights my proficiency in developing accessible and functional user interfaces.</p>
          <h3>Technical Highlights</h3>
          <p><b>Object-Oriented Design: </b>The application is structured around key OOP principles, utilizing inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. This design approach allows for efficient code management and scalability.</p>
          <p><b>Error Handling and Validation: </b>Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to ensure smooth operation and user feedback during invalid transactions or inputs.</p>
          <p><b>Graphical User Interface (GUI): </b>Developed using Java's Swing framework, the GUI is both responsive and intuitive, making the application accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.</p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>The Simple ATM Application is a testament to my capabilities in Java programming and GUI development. It serves as a practical example of how software can be designed to simplify and emulate real-world financial transactions, making it a significant
             and relevant 
            addition to my portfolio.

        <a href="https://github.com/tpturjo/tpturjo.github.io" target="_blank" class="github-link">View on GitHub</a>
        <div class="project-details" id="project2Details" style="display: none;">
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>I created this "Personal Portfolio Website" because I felt a resume wasn't enough to fully express my experiences, passions, and the projects I've worked on. I wanted a simple platform where I could share more about myself, my skills, and the work I've done. 
            I built this basic version of the website in just one day, so it's straightforward, but it serves its purpose for now.</p>
          <h3>Features</h3>
          <p><b>Simple Navigation: </b> Easy to browse through different sections of my professional life.</p>
          <p><b>About Me: </b> A brief introduction to who I am and what drives my career in technology.</p>
          <p><b>Skills and Experience: </b>A summary of my technical abilities and past experiences.</p>
          <p><b>Project Details:</b> A quick look at the projects I have completed and my hands-on coding experience.</p>
          <p><b>Contact Info: </b> Direct access to reach me for connections or opportunities.</p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>While it is a basic website for now, it reflects my desire to go beyond a traditional resume and showcase my work in a more dynamic way. As I grow and learn, I will try to evolve this website along with my skills.</p>

        <h2>Performance Review Web Application</h2>
        <span class="project-date">October 2023 - December 2023</span>
        <p>A full-stack project for managing and sharing professional reviews, demonstrating agile development practices.</p>
        <button class="details-btn" onclick="toggleDetails('project3Details')">Details</button>
        <a href="https://github.com/tpturjo/Performance-Review-Web-Application" target="_blank" class="github-link">View on GitHub</a>
        <div class="project-details" id="project3Details" style="display: none;">
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>The Performance Review Web Application project exemplifies a modern, agile approach to full-stack development, culminating in a robust platform for managing and sharing professional reviews. Over three months and 45 scrum meetings, our team 
            meticulously crafted 
            this application using a client-server model, ensuring adherence to industry standards and scalable architecture. </p>
          <h3>Development Methodology</h3>
          <p>Adopting the Agile methodology, the project journey was marked by iterative development, continuous integration, and adaptive planning. The implementation followed a structured process model, emphasizing regular sprint reviews, daily stand-ups, and
