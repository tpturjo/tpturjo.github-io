      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello there! I'm Tridib Paul Turjo, currently a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Smart Systems at Memorial University of Newfoundland. My passion for technology ignited during my teenage years, and I've been on an exciting journey of exploration ever since. I'm particularly drawn to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics for their incredible capabilities.
        <br><br>
        I approach life with a logical and adaptable mindset, which helps me tackle problems creatively. I thrive in collaborative settings, always eager to contribute my best to a team. Beyond my tech interests, I have a range of hobbies that I enjoy. I may not be a professional musician, but playing the guitar brings me joy. In my free time, I indulge in street photography, capturing candid moments. Engaging in meaningful conversations about politics, diverse cultures, and religions is another interest of mine. These discussions broaden my horizons and allow me to see the world from various perspectives.
        <br><br>
        To me, life is an adventure filled with ups and downs. I cherish every moment and make the most of each experience. Let's embark on this journey together and discover the incredible facets that life has to offer.

      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <div class="project">
        <h2>Project Name:Simple ATM Application</h2>
        <p>The ""Simple ATM Application" is a Java project that replicates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). Users can interact with their bank accounts, make deposits and 
          withdrawals, and view account information. The application provides a user-friendly graphical interface for easy access to basic banking operations. This project demonstrates my 
          Java programming skills, object-oriented design, and graphical user interface development expertise, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio as a practical financial software example.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project">
        <h2>Project Name: Personal Portfolio Website</h2>
        <p>Personal Portfolio Website" is a beginner-level project created using HTML and CSS. This website serves as a platform to showcase my skills, experiences, and projects. The site 
          features a user-friendly navigation menu, an "About Me" section introducing myself, a section displaying my technical skills and experience, and a list of projects I've worked on. Additionally, there's 
          a "Contact Me" section with links to my email and social media profiles. While I'm still learning, this project is a stepping stone in my journey to create functional and aesthetically pleasing web pages, 
          and I plan to continue improving it as I enhance my web development skills.</p>

        <h2>Project Name: Performance Review Web Application</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The Performance Review Web Application project exemplifies a modern, agile approach to full-stack development, culminating in a robust platform for managing and sharing professional reviews. Over three months and 45 scrum meetings, our team meticulously crafted 
          this application using a client-server model, ensuring adherence to industry standards and scalable architecture. </p>
        <h3>Development Methodology</h3>
        <p>Adopting the Agile methodology, the project journey was marked by iterative development, continuous integration, and adaptive planning. The implementation followed a structured process model, emphasizing regular sprint reviews, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives,
           which promoted a dynamic and responsive development environment. </p>
        <h3>Technical Stack and Role</h3>
        <p>As a key contributor, I spearheaded the routing mechanisms, ensuring seamless navigation and server-side request handling. My responsibilities also extended to rigorous testing, employing both Postman for API endpoint validation and unit tests for backend logic 
          assurance. My contribution to HTML development facilitated an intuitive user interface, while database management tasks ensured data integrity and secure account operations.</p>
        <h3>Architecture and Design</h3>
        <p>Our architecture, meticulously detailed in the Component Architecture Document, leverages the Bottle framework and SQLite for backend operations, paired with HTML/CSS for a responsive front-end. The application's server-side logic, with a focus on modular design 
          and session management, underscores the project's maintainability and testability. A comprehensive UML diagram and process model analysis document the application's workflow and the interconnection of its components.</p>
        <h3>Testing and Quality Assurance</h3>
        <p>Quality was paramount, reflected in the thorough API and unit testing coverage, ensuring every feature met functional and performance benchmarks. The dual-faceted testing strategy guarantees comprehensive coverage, maintaining system integrity against new changes 
          and fostering confidence in the application's stability with each release.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This Performance Review Web Application stands as a testament to a well-coordinated team effort, showcasing my commitment to quality software engineering practices and my ability to contribute significantly to a large-scale project. The application not only embodies a harmonious blend of
           functionality and user experience but also serves as a benchmark for future endeavors in developing scalable, industry-standard web applications.</p>
