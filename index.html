      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello there! I'm Tridib Paul Turjo, currently a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Smart Systems at Memorial University of Newfoundland. My passion for technology ignited during my teenage years,
         and I've been on an exciting journey of exploration ever since. I'm particularly drawn to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics for their incredible capabilities.
        <br><br>
        I approach life with a logical and adaptable mindset, which helps me tackle problems creatively. I thrive in collaborative settings, always eager to contribute my best to a team. Beyond my tech interests, I have a range of hobbies that I enjoy. I may not
         be a professional musician, but playing the guitar brings me joy. In my free time, I indulge in street photography, capturing candid moments. Engaging in meaningful conversations about politics, diverse cultures, and religions is another interest of 
         mine. These discussions broaden my horizons and allow me to see the world from various perspectives.
        <br><br>
        To me, life is an adventure filled with ups and downs. I cherish every moment and make the most of each experience. Let's embark on this journey together and discover the incredible facets that life has to offer.
